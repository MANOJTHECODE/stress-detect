# stress-detection
The Stress Detection project aims to develop a model that can analyze text input and determine whether a person is experiencing stress or not. By leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms, the model can classify the emotional state based on the provided text.

# Dataset
The project utilizes a labeled dataset, consisting of text samples that are labeled as either "stressed" or "not stressed." However, for privacy reasons, the actual dataset used for training is not included in this repository. To demonstrate the functionality, a sample dataset is provided in the data folder.

# Dependencies
To run the Stress Detection project, the following dependencies are required:

Python 3.x
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
nltk (Natural Language Toolkit)

# Future Work
Our goal is to create an application or website that addresses the issue of stress and provides users with suitable songs or videos to help reduce their stress levels. The platform will focus on understanding the stress levels of users and recommending content that promotes relaxation and well-being.

##### Stress Assessment and Personalized Recommendations:

The application/website will feature a stress assessment tool where users can evaluate their current stress levels. Based on the assessment results, personalized recommendations will be generated, suggesting songs or videos that have been proven to alleviate stress. These recommendations will be tailored to each individual's preferences and mood.

##### Comprehensive Music and Video Library:

The platform will host a diverse library of stress-relieving songs and videos. The content will be categorized based on their stress-reducing qualities, allowing users to explore various genres, artists, or themes that resonate with them. This comprehensive library ensures that users have access to a wide range of content to suit their preferences.
