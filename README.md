# stress-detection
The Stress Detection project aims to develop a model that can analyze text input and determine whether a person is experiencing stress or not. By leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms, the model can classify the emotional state based on the provided text.

#Dataset
The project utilizes a labeled dataset, consisting of text samples that are labeled as either "stressed" or "not stressed." However, for privacy reasons, the actual dataset used for training is not included in this repository. To demonstrate the functionality, a sample dataset is provided in the data folder.

#Dependencies
To run the Stress Detection project, the following dependencies are required:

Python 3.x
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
nltk (Natural Language Toolkit)
